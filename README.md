Application that unites different package tracking API's - 
The intention for this project is for the user to input different tracking numbers, 
the program then returns the current status of the package associated with that tracking 
number and automatically refreshes that status at set intervals. This program came about 
as a resolution to me constantly checking the status of things I ordered online.

# Project Status
In progress at the moment, the program can handle a single tracking number and 
successfully returns its current status.
